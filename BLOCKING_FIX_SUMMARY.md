# Blocking Fix Summary

## Problem
Users could still see posts from blocked users after refreshing the page, even though blocking worked initially.

## Root Cause
Multiple timing and synchronization issues:

1. **Timing Issue**: Posts were loaded before the BlockingContext finished loading blocked users from the database
2. **Multiple Data Sources**: Different parts of the code were fetching blocked users separately instead of using a single source of truth
3. **Race Conditions**: Real-time subscriptions and initial loads weren't properly synchronized

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced BlockingContext
- Added `isLoading` state to track when blocked users are being fetched
- Now provides a reliable way to know when the context is ready
- Maintains a single source of truth for blocked user IDs

### 2. Fixed Post Loading Logic
- Modified `loadPosts()` to use `blockedUserIds` from BlockingContext instead of fetching separately
- Added proper dependency management in useEffect hooks
- Posts are now only loaded after BlockingContext finishes loading

### 3. Synchronized Real-time Updates
- Updated real-time subscriptions to use BlockingContext instead of separate DB queries
- Ensured all post filtering uses the same blocked user list
- Removed redundant blocking logic

## Key Changes

### In `context/BlockingContext.tsx`:
- Added `isLoading: boolean` to the context interface
- Added loading state management in `refreshBlockedUsers()`
- Context now properly indicates when it's ready

### In `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`:
- Changed `loadPosts()` to use BlockingContext's `blockedUserIds`
- Updated useEffect to depend on both `blockedUserIds` and `blockingLoading`
- Removed duplicate blocked user fetching logic
- Updated real-time subscriptions to use BlockingContext

## How It Works Now

1. **App Startup**: BlockingContext loads blocked users from database
2. **Context Ready**: `isLoading` becomes `false`, indicating data is ready
3. **Posts Load**: Only after BlockingContext is ready, posts are fetched with proper filtering
4. **Block Action**: When user blocks someone, context updates immediately and posts reload
5. **Page Refresh**: BlockingContext loads first, then posts are properly filtered

## Result
✅ Blocking now works permanently across page refreshes
✅ No more race conditions between context loading and post fetching
✅ Single source of truth for blocked users
✅ Consistent blocking behavior across all app states
